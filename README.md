## Finding Falcone

After the recent war with neighbouring planet Falicornia, King Shan of Lengaburu has exiled the Queen of Falicornia
for 15 years.<br> If the king could find the queen who is now in hiding within 15 years, she will be exiled for the
next 15 years.<br> This project is to help the King so that he could use his limited resources for his advantage and hence
find the Queen.<br>
